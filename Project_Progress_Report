Project Title: Smart Home Energy Consumption Analysis
Internship Phase: Data Exploration, Preprocessing & Time-Series Analysis
1. DATA EXPLORATION (HomeC.csv)
Dataset Overview:
- 503,911 rows
- 32 features
- 28 numerical columns
- 4 object columns (time, icon, summary, cloudCover)

Key Steps Performed:
- Loaded dataset using pandas
- Checked null values and data types
- Converted UNIX time column to datetime
- Removed invalid timestamp entries
- Set timestamp as index
- Sorted data chronologically

Descriptive Statistics:
- Mean overall power usage: 0.8589 kW
- Maximum usage observed: 14.71 kW
- High variability detected in consumption patterns

Zone-wise Energy Aggregation:
Appliances grouped into:
- Kitchen Zone
- Living Zone
- Heating Zone
- Utility Zone

Energy Contribution:
- Heating: ~42%
- Living: ~21%
- Kitchen: ~21%
- Utility: ~16%

Insight:
Heating is the dominant energy-consuming zone.

2. HOURLY & ANOMALY ANALYSIS
Hourly Analysis:
- Extracted hour from timestamp
- Calculated hourly average energy usage
- Peak hour detected at 23:00
- Lowest average around early afternoon

High Energy Detection:
Used statistical threshold:
    Threshold = Mean + (2 × Std Dev)

- Identified significant number of high-usage events
- Living zone showed frequent spikes
- Utility zone showed rare but extreme peaks

Result:
Energy spikes and daily patterns clearly identified.

3. SYNTHETIC CLEAN DATA PREPROCESSING
Dataset:
- 4,321 rows
- 6 columns (timestamp, fridge, ac, lights, microwave, total_power)
- Hourly data from Jan 2023 to June 2023

Preprocessing Steps:
- Converted timestamp to datetime
- Set timestamp as index
- Verified proper time ordering

Time Series Decomposition:
Used additive model:
    Y(t) = Trend + Seasonality + Residual

- Period set to 24 (daily cycle)
- Trend, seasonal and residual components visualized
- Seasonal strength calculated: 0.00286

Observation:
Very weak seasonality detected in total_power.

4. WEEKDAY VS WEEKEND ANALYSIS
Weekday Average: 958.44
Weekend Average: 976.26

Observation:
Weekend consumption slightly higher than weekdays

5. MONTHLY TREND
- Resampled data monthly
- Computed average monthly consumption
- Observed stable energy pattern across months

6. DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
Statistical Measures:
- Skewness: 0.4641 (slightly right-skewed)
- Kurtosis: -1.2595 (platykurtic, light tails)

Histogram with normal curve overlay showed:
- Data roughly symmetric
- No extreme heavy-tail behavior

7. FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS (FFT)
Applied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to detect dominant periodicity.

Result:
- Dominant detected period ≈ 4321 hours
  (Corresponds to full dataset length)

Interpretation:
No strong repeating short-term cycle detected beyond overall trend.
