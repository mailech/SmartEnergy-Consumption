## 🔹 Module 1 – Data Collection & Understanding

In this module:

- Loaded the Smart Home Energy dataset.
- Explored dataset structure and feature details.
- Verified data integrity and checked missing values.
- Performed basic statistical analysis.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Analyzed correlation between energy features.

Objective:  
To understand energy usage patterns across devices and environmental factors.

## 🔹 Module 2 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

In this module:

- Converted UNIX timestamp to datetime format.
- Set datetime as index for time-series processing.
- Handled missing values using forward-fill method.
- Removed duplicate timestamps.
- Resampled data into hourly and daily intervals.
- Treated outliers using the IQR method.
- Normalized energy features using MinMaxScaler.
- Split dataset into Train (70%), Validation (15%), and Test (15%) sets.

Objective:  
To prepare clean and structured data suitable for machine learning models.
